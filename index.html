<h2>A Link Grammar Parser for Persian</h2>
<p>LING 539</p>
<p>Robert Gray</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial discusses a Link Grammar parser for Persian written by Jonathan Dehdari in 2005. It is part of a larger Link Grammar parsing project developed by Linas Vepstas (written in C), based on the foundational work in Link Grammar by Daniel Sleator, David Temperley, and John Lafferty. There are several other languages with grammars in development, but the grammars for English, Russian, and Persian appear to be the most exhaustive and best functioning. The following sections will go over the basics of Link Grammar, Persian pre-processing issues, getting the parser/grammar to work in a Linux environment, and an analysis of Dehdari’s work.</p>
<h3>Link Grammar basics</h3>
<p>Link Grammar is a method of analyzing sentences that focuses on the links of a tree as opposed to its nodes. The idea of ‘head’ is more or less ignored, both words being linked being given equal status. The tree is simply a collection of links between two words. The parser discussed here tags each morpheme of the input and then generates links between pairs of words. The grammar file for Persian (link-grammar-5.9.1/data/fa/4.0.dict) details the rules for tagging and linking. Some examples of tags used are: n (noun), nms (noun morphemes), vmn (negative verb prefix), vmd (continuous/durative verbal prefix), vms (imperative/subjunctive verbal prefix), vmt (verbal tense suffix), vmo (verbal object suffix), vmp (verbal subject suffix) NOT DONE YET</p>
<h3>Pre-processing</h3>
<p>Before providing the parser with input text, the text must be pre-processed. Some aspects of this process are straightforward, others are more complicated and unique to Persian. Dehdari developed another program (in Perl) that performs this pre-processing, but it can also be done manually with some knowledge of Persian. For more information on his morphological parser, Perstem, please visit https://github.com/jonsafari/perstem.</p>
<p>The first step is to convert Arabic script into the Latin alphabet. The Link Grammar parser uses a one-to-one correspondence between the Arabic letters and some glyph from the standard Latin alphabet, using lowercase and capital letters, and some punctuation to represent all of the letters of the Persian alphabet (see https://jon.dehdari.org/persian_nlp/persian_charmaps.pdf). One problem with this step is that of the Zero-Width Non-Joiner character (or ZWNJ), which allows two letters to be juxtaposed without joining as they would normally (Arabic letters usually join to either/both the preceding or/and following letters). It is used to separate some grammatical markers from the stems they are attached to and between the members of a compound word. The ZWNJ is converted to a hyphen character during this step.</p>
<p>The next step is to determine where ezafes are needed throughout the text. The ezafe is simply the vowel /e/. It is suffixed onto various elements of noun phrases as a linking device. The problem is that ezafes are not always explicit in the text. In certain environments they are visible as the letter ‘yeh’, but more often they are unwritten, and the reader must deduce their position from the context. By making them explicit in pre-processing, the design of the parser grammar can be simplified (no deduction needed).</p>
<p>The last step in pre-processing is ezafe-formatting and morpheme-splitting. First, all ezafes must be written the same way, using the Latin letter ‘e’. For example, if the ezafe is explicit in the text as the Arabic letter ‘yeh’, this corresponds to the Latin letter ‘i’. In order to make all ezafe uniform, we rewrite them all as the Latin letter ‘e’. Next, all inflectional affixes need to be split up with spaces. The parser grammar cannot do this and will ignore important morphological information if a word is not broken up. Let’s look at an example that illustrates all the stages of pre-processing:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Original text</td>
    <td>من کتاب‌های بزرگ شما‌را نمی‌خواندم</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gloss/translation</td>
    <td>mæn  [ketɑb.hɑ.ye  bozorg.e  šomɑ].rɑ  ne.mi.xɑn.d.æm <br/> I  [book.PL.EZ  big.EZ  you]-ACC  NEG.CNT.read.PST.1SG <br/> 'I was not reading your big books.'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Arabic to Latin characters</td>
    <td>mn ktAb-hAi bzrg CmA-rA nmi-xuAndm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Insert implicit ezafe</td>
    <td>mn ktAb-hAi bzrg<span style="background-color: #66FF00"><b>e</b></span> CmA-rA nmi-xuAndm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Format ezafe</td>
    <td>mn ktAb-hAe bzrge CmA-rA nmi-xuAndm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Split morphemes with spaces</td>
    <td>mn ktAb hA e bzrg e CmA rA n mi xuAn d m</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>EZ = ezafe, CNT = continuous, PST = past, PL = plural, ACC = accusative, NEG = negative, 1SG = first person singular</p>
<p>In the gloss, the brackets surround the object NP to make it easier to see. The accusative suffix attaches to the NP as whole: it’s an enclitic. Using Dehdari’s list of character correspondences, the Arabic letters are switched out for Latin characters. Next, based on knowledge of Persian, one implicit/unwritten ezafe is needed after ‘bzrg’. Next, all ezafes are rewritten as ‘e’, so the first one after ‘ktAb-hA’ is changed from ‘i’ to ‘e’. Lastly, all morphemes are split using spaces (most ZWNJ will also become spaces). We now have text that the parser can accept as input.</p>
<h3>Setting up the parser in Linux</h3>
<p>The Link Grammar parser file (link-grammar-5.9.1.tar.gz) can be downloaded from http://www.abisource.com/downloads/link-grammar/current/. You will need to be able to navigate to the directory that you extract the file contents to. Using terminal, navigate to this directory using the ‘cd’ command (as a default it will be named ‘link-grammar-5.9.1’). The README.md file at https://github.com/opencog/link-grammar details how to create the Link Parser system in Linux; all commands can be done from the terminal once you have navigated to the correct directory.</p>
<p>Once the parsing system has been created, navigate to the link-grammar-5.9.1/data/fa subdirectory. This is the Persian language folder, containing all of the files necessary to run the Persian Link Parser. One of the files is named ‘4.0.dict’. This is the grammar file for Persian. Similar files exist for the other languages in the link-grammar-5.9.1/data directory. To make the ‘dict’ file work correctly with the Latin script input, this line of code needs to be removed towards the beginning:</p>
<p class="tab">#define dictionary-locale fa_IR.UTF-8;</p>
<p>The semicolon from the previous line (defining the dictionary version) should also be deleted. This will cause the parser to default to the en_US.UTF-8 character set.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to use the parser. Navigate to the ‘link-grammar-5.9.1’ directory as before, and type ‘link-parser fa’. The system will search for the ‘dict’ file for Persian and open the parser. On my own system, I extracted the parser files to a different directory - apart from this, the opening text on your system should be identical to this:</p>
<img src="/539-tutorial/initial.png" alt="initial input">
<p>Use the example sentence from the pre-processing section to test the parser. The output should be:</p>
<img src="/539-tutorial/parseexp1.png" alt="first parsing example">
<p>If the parser finds more than one tree for the given sentence, click enter/return to see the alternate trees, as above.</p>
